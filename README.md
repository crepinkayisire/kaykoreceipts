I was reading on the power of network effects and thinking on how we can use them at Kayko

So, I decided to build a receipt preview experience Kayko merchants can instantly share with customers via SMS or WhatsApp after every sale.

I saw that in June alone 2,974 unique customers left their phone numbers with Kayko merchants.

This is a clear opportunity to start building network effects through customer engagement.



The Idea:

Each receipt becomes a branded, trackable, and shareable link giving customers a professional experience and introducing them to Kayko.

Beyond the receipt itself, this could be a gateway to future features that deepen the relationship between merchants and their patrons. Think:

Ratings and reviews

Online shopping 

Loyalty points

VAT Refunds

A personal wallet

This could:

Strengthen merchant-customer relationships

Boost product visibility

Kickstart viral growth through the customers of our customers

Would love your thoughts on the flow before we begin testing.
